# CA Sri Lanka CL1: Advanced Audit & Assurance - Study Guide for High-Value Topics

This guide focuses on recurring topics that consistently carry significant marks in the CL1 Advanced Audit & Assurance examination, based on an analysis of past papers from December 2020 to June 2024 and their suggested solutions.

## I. Audit Reporting (Very High Value)

**Importance/Frequency:** This is arguably the most critical area in Sections 2 and 3, frequently tested with scenarios requiring detailed implications for the auditor's report.

**Key Concepts & Learning Outcomes Tested:**

* Understanding and applying SLAuS 700 (Forming an Opinion and Reporting on Financial Statements), SLAuS 701 (Communicating Key Audit Matters), SLAuS 705 (Modifications to the Opinion), and SLAuS 706 (Emphasis of Matter Paragraphs and Other Matter Paragraphs).
* Determining the appropriate type of audit opinion (Unmodified, Qualified, Adverse, Disclaimer) based on the materiality and pervasiveness of misstatements or scope limitations.
* Identifying and articulating Key Audit Matters (KAMs), understanding their purpose, and how they differ from a modified opinion.
* Correctly using Emphasis of Matter paragraphs for issues appropriately disclosed by management but fundamental to users' understanding (e.g., material uncertainty related to going concern, significant subsequent events).
* Drafting the "Basis for Opinion" (or Basis for Qualified/Adverse/Disclaimer of Opinion) paragraph clearly explaining the reasons for any modification.
* Reporting implications for going concern issues (see specific section below).
* Reporting on comparatives and other information.

**Common Question Types/Scenarios:**

* Given a scenario with uncorrected material misstatements (e.g., incorrect inventory valuation, impairment issues, revenue recognition errors), determine the impact on the audit report and draft relevant sections.
* Scenarios involving scope limitations (e.g., inability to obtain sufficient evidence for a material balance).
* Deciding if a matter is a KAM, an EoM, or requires a modified opinion.
* Comparing an audit report with a review report.

**Examiner Expectations:**

* Precise application of SLAuS.
* Clear justification for the chosen opinion/modification, linking back to materiality and pervasiveness.
* Ability to draft report extracts with correct headings and professional language.
* Understanding that KAMs do not substitute for a modified opinion when financial statements are materially misstated.

**Tips for Answering:**

* Always state the materiality of the issue first.
* Assess if the misstatement/limitation is pervasive.
* Clearly state the type of opinion.
* Explain why that opinion is appropriate, referencing the standards.
* If drafting, use the standard wording as closely as possible.

* Auditor's responsibilities regarding going concern under SLAuS 570.
* Identifying events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on an entity's ability to continue as a going concern (financial, operating, and other indicators).
* Evaluating management's assessment of going concern, including their plans and cash flow forecasts.
* Performing additional audit procedures when such events or conditions are identified.
* Concluding on the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting.
* Determining the implications for the auditor's report, including when a "Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern" paragraph is required or when the opinion needs modification if the going concern basis is inappropriate or disclosures are inadequate.

**Common Question Types/Scenarios:**

* Companies experiencing losses, negative cash flows, net liability positions, loss of major customers, or reliance on uncertain financing.
* Assessing the adequacy of management's disclosures related to going concern.
* Evaluating the impact of subsequent events on the going concern assessment.
