# CL1 Advanced Audit and Assurance - December 2024 Paper: Selected Questions & Answers

## SECTION 2

### Question 02

> Creative Vision (Pvt) Ltd (CVL), an online trading company, is the newest audit client of A&M Chartered Accountants (A&M). The audit partner advised the audit team to use computer assisted audit techniques (CAATs) supported by A&M's audit software, since the processes at CVL are fully automated. CVL uses two internally developed software systems for local and export sales called SPAC 1 and RITO respectively. These two revenue systems have many key controls including the invoicing of sales, dispatch of goods, and customer acknowledgment - all automated through the two online systems. All invoices are paid for by the customers through the online system before the goods are dispatched. Revenue comprises low value transactions but a high volume of transactions for a given financial year.

**(a) Question:** State three (03) major steps that A&M should consider in the application of CAATs? (3 marks)
**Answer:**
When A&M Chartered Accountants consider the application of Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATs) for the audit of Creative Vision (Pvt) Ltd (CVL), they should consider several major steps. Three such major steps include:

-   **Set the objective of the CAAT application:** A&M must clearly define what they aim to achieve by using CAATs. For CVL, objectives could include testing the completeness and accuracy of high-volume revenue transactions processed through SPAC 1 and RITO, or evaluating the effectiveness of automated controls within these systems. The overall objectives and scope of an audit do not change when an audit is conducted in a computerised environment, but the application of auditing procedures may require auditors to consider techniques that use the computer as an audit tool.
-   **Determine the content and accessibility of the entity's files:** A&M needs to understand the structure, content, and format of CVL's data files for SPAC 1 and RITO. This includes assessing the reliability of the data and whether it can be easily accessed and processed by A&M's audit software. The auditors need to ensure data integrity before processing.
-   **Define the transaction types to be tested:** A&M must specify which transactions within CVL's local and export sales systems (SPAC 1 and RITO) will be subjected to CAATs. Given the high volume of low-value transactions, CAATs can be used for tests of details of these transactions. For example, they might focus on all export sales above a certain threshold processed by RITO to verify rebate eligibility.

> *(The suggested solution lists ten steps, from which these three have been selected and elaborated based on the study text and scenario details.)*

**(b) Question:** Describe how test data techniques can be used in performing tests of controls. (3 marks)
**Answer:**
Test data techniques are used by auditors to conduct audit procedures by entering data (e.g., a sample of transactions, which can be actual or dummy/artificial) into an entity's computer system, and comparing the results obtained with pre-determined, expected results. This method is specifically used for performing tests of controls within the client's application systems. For CVL, A&M could use test data techniques on the SPAC 1 and RITO systems in the following ways:

-   **Testing Specific Programmed Controls:** A&M can create test data to check specific controls programmed into SPAC 1 and RITO, such as online password and data access controls, or controls over the automated invoicing and dispatch process. For example, they could attempt to process a dispatch without prior online payment to see if the system prevents it, as CVL's policy is that all invoices are paid before goods are dispatched.
-   **Testing Processing Characteristics for Invalid Data:** Test transactions can be created by A&M (or selected from previously processed transactions) to check controls that prevent the processing of invalid or erroneous data. For instance, A&M could input data with a non-existent customer code, an unreasonable transaction value, or an attempt to exceed pre-set credit limits (if applicable, though CVL operates on pre-payment) into SPAC 1 or RITO to see if the systems correctly reject or flag these entries.
-   **Using an Integrated Test Facility (ITF):** Though less common for specific control tests like these, an ITF involves establishing a 'dummy' unit (e.g., a dummy customer account within SPAC 1 or RITO) to which test transactions are posted during the normal processing cycle. This allows A&M to see how controls operate under normal processing conditions without disrupting CVL's live operations, checking if automated controls related to invoicing, dispatch, and customer acknowledgment function as expected.

The results from these test data procedures would provide A&M with evidence about the operating effectiveness of the automated controls within CVL's revenue systems.

> CVL applies for export rebates on all exports above an invoice value of USD1,000. Management of CVL wishes to get an agreed-upon procedures report signed by the external auditor to be submitted to the export development board (EDB) to apply for the export rebate scheme.

**(c) Question:** Outline four (04) key elements of the agreed-upon procedures report that you would prepare for CVL, excluding the title, addressee, and auditor's details. (4 marks)
**Answer:**
Excluding the title, addressee, and auditor's details, four key elements of the agreed-upon procedures report prepared for CVL, in accordance with **SLSRE 4400**, would be:

1.  **Identification of specific financial or non-financial information to which the agreed-upon procedures have been applied:** The report would clearly identify the specific export sales transactions of CVL (e.g., those above USD 1,000 from the RITO system) that were subject to the agreed-upon procedures for the purpose of the export rebate scheme application to the EDB.
2.  **A statement that the procedures performed were those agreed upon with the recipient:** The report would explicitly state that the procedures performed were those agreed with CVL's management and, if applicable, the Export Development Board (EDB), as they are the parties who will rely on the report. This clarifies that the scope was determined by agreement and not by the auditor's judgment for an audit or review.
3.  **A listing of the specific procedures performed:** The report must detail the exact nature and extent of the procedures A&M carried out on CVL's export sales data. For example, "Verified a sample of X export invoices over USD1,000 against shipping documents and customer acknowledgements from the RITO system to confirm eligibility criteria for the EDB rebate scheme."
4.  **A description of the auditor's factual findings including sufficient details of errors and exceptions found:** The report will present the factual results of the procedures applied to CVL's export transactions. This would include a summary of the transactions tested and any exceptions or discrepancies noted (e.g., "X out of Y invoices tested met the criteria; Z invoices did not, due to [reason]"). It is important to note that the report presents findings and does not express an opinion or assurance.

> Other important elements would include stating that the engagement was performed per **SLSRE 4400**, identifying the purpose of the engagement (submission to EDB for export rebates), a statement that the procedures do not constitute an audit or review and thus no assurance is expressed, and a restriction on the distribution of the report to the agreed parties.

### Question 03

> Tech Solutions (Pvt) Ltd (TSL), a software development firm, has implemented a hybrid working arrangement for its staff. While this has boosted employee satisfaction, it has also led to challenges in communication and collaboration amongst teams as it has hindered the understanding of the company's culture and values. TSL is led by a team comprising long-serving executives and newly hired managers. The monitoring reports indicate that certain project outcomes are below expectations mainly due to a lack of clarity in responsibilities. The HR department of TSL has also noted inconsistencies in how ethical guidelines are communicated and enforced across different teams, leading to confusion regarding acceptable business practices. During a recent strategic planning meeting, the board expressed concerns about employees' commitment to competence, particularly in view of several high-profile project failures.

**(a) Question:** Outline deficiencies in the control environment of TSL, which may have an impact on the company's performance and risk management. (You are expected to provide three (03) points taking into consideration the elements of the control environment) (6 marks)
**Answer:**
Deficiencies in the control environment of Tech Solutions (Pvt) Ltd (TSL) that may impact its performance and risk management, considering the elements of the control environment, include:

1.  **Communication and enforcement of integrity and ethical values:** There are inconsistencies in how ethical guidelines are communicated and enforced across different teams at TSL, leading to confusion. A weak control environment regarding ethics can undermine the effectiveness of other controls and increase the risk of unethical behavior or non-compliance. The challenges in communication due to the hybrid model further hinder the understanding and reinforcement of company culture and values.
2.  **Commitment to competence:** The board has expressed concerns about employees' commitment to competence, especially after several high-profile project failures. This suggests potential gaps in skills, training, or performance evaluation. Management's consideration of competence levels for particular jobs and how these translate into requisite skills and knowledge is a key element of the control environment. If competence is lacking, projects may fail, and risks may not be adequately managed.
3.  **Organisational structure and Assignment of authority and responsibility:** The hybrid working arrangement has led to challenges in collaboration and a lack of clarity in responsibilities, contributing to project outcomes being below expectations. An effective organisational structure provides the framework within which an entity's activities for achieving its objectives are planned, executed, controlled, and reviewed. If roles and responsibilities are not clearly defined, especially with a mix of long-serving executives and new managers, accountability is weakened, and risk management may be ineffective.

> *(The suggested solution highlights these points. The study text discusses elements of the control environment in Chapter 2.)*

> The audit senior has documented the current sales process of TSL as follows.
> Lead tracking: Sales representatives use the Enzure system to enter and track sales leads / opportunities. However, the system has not been configured appropriately to capture the required information for report generation and mandatory information fields.
> Sales ordering: Once a lead is qualified, a sales representative prepares a sales order through the system detailing the project scope, timelines, and pricing. These orders are managed by individual sales representatives and directly sent to the operations team for project planning.
> Milestone invoicing: Invoices are issued at specific project milestones based on contract terms with sales. Sales representatives manually calculate invoice amounts. After the invoices are printed, they are sent to customers, often leading to concerns and the issuance of credit notes.
> Ledger maintenance: The finance team maintains a separate ledger account in the general ledger, recording transactions using copies of the invoices. This ledger operates independently from the invoicing system without performing a reconciliation of the values in the two modules.

**(b) Question:** Evaluate the sales process of TSL to identify four (04) deficiencies in it that can lead to errors and misstatement of sales. (4 marks)
**Answer:**
Four deficiencies in TSL's sales process that can lead to errors and misstatement of sales are:

1.  **Inadequate Lead Tracking System Configuration:** The Enzure system used for tracking sales leads is not configured appropriately to capture required information for report generation or enforce mandatory information fields. This can lead to incomplete or inaccurate data for sales analysis and follow-up, potentially resulting in missed sales opportunities or errors in recognizing revenue if leads are not properly processed. This affects the information processing aspect of control activities.
2.  **Lack of Approval for Sales Orders:** Sales orders prepared by individual sales representatives detailing project scope, timelines, and pricing are sent directly to the operations team without any apparent independent review or authorization by a supervisor or senior manager. This lack of segregation of duties and approval increases the risk of unauthorized or inaccurate orders (e.g., incorrect pricing, unrealistic timelines) being processed, which could lead to revenue misstatements or customer dissatisfaction.
3.  **Manual Calculation and Lack of Review for Milestone Invoices:** Sales representatives manually calculate invoice amounts for project milestones, and these invoices are sent to customers without an independent check. This creates a high risk of arithmetical errors or misapplication of contract terms in invoicing, leading to incorrect revenue recognition and frequent issuance of credit notes due to customer concerns. This also points to a deficiency in checking the arithmetical accuracy of records.
4.  **No Reconciliation Between Invoicing System and General Ledger:** The finance team maintains a separate sales ledger account in the general ledger using copies of invoices, but this operates independently from the Enzure invoicing system without reconciliation between the two. This lack of reconciliation means that discrepancies, such as missing invoices, duplicate entries, or posting errors, between the operational sales system and the financial accounting records may go undetected, leading to misstated sales revenue and receivables. Maintaining and reviewing control accounts and performing reconciliations are key control activities.

### Question 04

> Tally Associates (TA) is a firm of chartered accountants performing audits of specified business enterprises. One of their audit files was reviewed by the Sri Lanka Accounting and Auditing Standards Monitoring Board (SLAASMB). Subsequently, the following observations were communicated to the senior partner of TA.
>
> (i) The audit documentation did not clearly demonstrate how the engagement team determined the reasonableness of cash flows, the discount rate, and other judgement areas in the impairment calculation for goodwill and property, plant, and equipment (PPE). It was noted that the management had used a complex impairment model, and there was no evidence of consultation with specialists or technical experts regarding the significant judgment areas.
> (ii) It was noted that during the year, the audit client had launched a new product with multiple performance obligations. Audit documentation regarding the complex revenue recognition of the new product lacked conclusions.
> (iii) The audit file documentation suggests that the audit partner had not reviewed some of the working papers relating to significant risk areas. The audit partner's time charged was only 8 hours compared to the total of 1,000 hours charged by all team members.
> (iv) The audit client is a public listed company. There was no evidence of compliance with SLAUS 220 Quality Control for an Audit of Financial Statements para 25.

**(a) Question:** Discuss four (04) quality control procedures that TA could implement at the engagement level based on the observations above. (4 marks)
**Answer:**
Based on the SLAASMB observations, Tally Associates (TA) could implement the following four quality control procedures at the engagement level to address the deficiencies:

1.  **Enhanced Consultation and Use of Experts for Complex Judgements:** For areas involving complex models and significant judgement, such as the impairment calculation for goodwill and PPE using management's complex model, TA should implement a policy requiring consultation with specialists or technical experts, either internal or external. The engagement team should document the nature, scope, and conclusions of these consultations and how the expert's work was evaluated for adequacy, as per **SLAuS 620**. This addresses observation (i).
2.  **Thorough Documentation of Conclusions on Complex Accounting Matters:** For complex areas like revenue recognition for new products with multiple performance obligations, the engagement team must ensure audit documentation clearly outlines the procedures performed, evidence obtained, and the rationale for conclusions reached. This includes documenting how accounting policies were evaluated for appropriateness and consistency. This addresses observation (ii).
3.  **Improved Direction, Supervision, and Review by Engagement Partner:** The engagement partner must take overall responsibility for the direction, supervision, and review of the audit. This includes ensuring adequate time is allocated for reviewing working papers, especially those relating to significant risk areas. A minimum threshold for partner review time on significant risk areas could be established. The firm should ensure partners spend sufficient time coaching and guiding the team and reviewing their work in a timely manner. This directly addresses observation (iii) regarding insufficient partner review time.
4.  **Mandatory Engagement Quality Control Review (EQCR) for Listed Clients:** As the audit client is a public listed company, an EQCR is mandatory. TA must ensure that for all listed entity audits, an eligible engagement quality control reviewer is appointed. This reviewer will perform an objective evaluation of significant judgments made by the engagement team and the conclusions reached in formulating the auditor’s report before the report is issued. The EQCR must be documented in accordance with **SLAuS 220 para 25**, including confirmation that required procedures were performed, the review was completed by the report date, and the reviewer is unaware of unresolved matters affecting the appropriateness of judgements and conclusions. This addresses observation (iv).

> TA performs the audits of Signature PLC (SPLC), a long-standing client, who is currently experiencing financial difficulties. Zahra, the audit partner in the audit of SPLC, has been a close friend of the CEO of SPLC for many years. Recently, Zahra was involved in discussions with the CEO to evaluate the possibility of TA providing additional consulting services to help improve the financial performance of SPLC. TA has a significant amount of fees earned from SPLC. Zahra is concerned that any unfavourable audit findings could affect her personal relationship with the CEO and the ongoing professional services relationship between TA and SPLC.

**(b) Question:** Outline three (03) potential threats to compliance with the fundamental ethical principles for Zahra and TA when dealing with SPLC. (6 marks)
**Answer:**
Three potential threats to compliance with the fundamental ethical principles for Zahra and Tally Associates (TA) when dealing with Signature PLC (SPLC) are:

1.  **Familiarity Threat:** Zahra, the audit partner, has a long-standing close friendship with the CEO of SPLC. This long and close personal relationship can create a familiarity threat to objectivity and professional scepticism. Zahra might become too sympathetic to SPLC's interests or too accepting of the CEO's representations, especially given SPLC's financial difficulties, and may be less likely to challenge management or exercise rigorous scrutiny.
2.  **Self-interest Threat:** TA earns a significant amount of fees from SPLC, and SPLC is a long-standing client experiencing financial difficulties. This situation creates a self-interest threat because TA (and Zahra) might be concerned about losing a significant client if unfavourable audit findings are reported, potentially impacting the firm's revenue. Zahra's concern about affecting the ongoing professional services relationship due to unfavourable audit findings highlights this threat. The desire to retain the client and the associated fees could inappropriately influence Zahra's judgement.
3.  **Advocacy and/or Self-review Threat (from potential consulting services):** Zahra's involvement in discussions with the CEO about TA providing additional consulting services to help improve SPLC's financial performance creates potential threats. If TA provides such consulting services, particularly those involving strategic decisions or performance improvement measures, an advocacy threat could arise if TA is perceived as promoting SPLC's interests. Furthermore, if these consulting services involve designing systems or making recommendations that subsequently form part of the financial reporting process or internal controls, a self-review threat would exist when TA audits these areas.

### Question 05

> BC Chartered Accountants currently carrying out the audit of AX PLC. At the planning stage of the AX PLC audit, the overall financial statement materiality was determined using a benchmark approach. AX has many shareholders, and it is the 5th largest market capitalised company listed on the Colombo stock exchange and has a good track record of paying dividends. The audit team has provided the following financial information regarding AX.
>
> AX revenue: Rs. 1,213 million
> AX gross profit: Rs. 712 million
> AX profit before tax: Rs. 119 million
>
> At the finalisation stage of AX's audit, the following two significant misstatements were identified, both involving valuation audit assertions which are considered to have a significant risk of material misstatements.
>
> (i) Trade receivables impairment: The management. applied inappropriate assumptions when calculating the expected credit loss, leading to an understatement of Rs. 3 million.
> (ii) Understatement of inventory value: An error in the calculation of the net realisable value resulted in an understatement of Rs. 2 million.
>
> The carrying values of inventory and debtors were concluded to be key audit matters (KAMs).

**(a) Question:** Calculate the materiality of AX at the planning level, using the appropriate benchmark, and provide a justification for your choice of benchmark. (3 marks)
**Answer:**
**Choice of Benchmark and Justification:**
For AX PLC, a listed company with many shareholders and a good track record of paying dividends, **profit before tax (PBT)** is generally considered an appropriate benchmark. Users of financial statements of listed companies, particularly shareholders, often focus on profitability and earnings as key indicators of performance and the ability to pay dividends. Since AX PLC has a good track record of paying dividends, PBT directly impacts the distributable profits and is a critical figure for shareholders.

**Materiality Calculation:**
A common percentage applied to PBT for calculating materiality is 5%.
PBT for AX PLC = Rs. 119 million
Materiality at planning level = 5% of Rs. 119 million
= 0.05 * 119,000,000
= **Rs. 5.95 million**

**(b) Question:** The management has agreed to adjust the understatement of the trade receivables impairment but requested to consider the inventory understatement as an audit difference. No other audit differences were noted other than (i) and (ii) mentioned above. Compute the final and revised materiality level of AX PLC to evaluate the impact of the understatement of inventory in finalising the audit. (2 marks)
**Answer:**
To compute the final and revised materiality level, we first need to adjust the reported Profit Before Tax (PBT) for the misstatement that management has agreed to correct.
Initial PBT = Rs. 119 million
Adjustment for understatement of trade receivables impairment (this will reduce PBT) = Rs. 3 million
Adjusted PBT = Rs. 119 million - Rs. 3 million = **Rs. 116 million**

Now, we calculate the revised materiality using the same percentage (5%) on the adjusted PBT:
Revised and Final Materiality = 5% of Rs. 116 million
= 0.05 * 116,000,000
= **Rs. 5.8 million**

The impact of the unadjusted inventory understatement of **Rs. 2 million** needs to be evaluated against this revised materiality of **Rs. 5.8 million**. Since Rs. 2 million is less than Rs. 5.8 million, this specific unadjusted misstatement, when considered alone, might be deemed immaterial. However, the auditor must also consider qualitative factors and the aggregate of all uncorrected misstatements.

**(c) Question:** Provide five (05) reasons for considering the carrying values of inventory and debtors as key audit matters (KAMs). (5 marks)
**Answer:**
Five reasons for considering the carrying values of inventory and debtors as Key Audit Matters (KAMs) for AX PLC, in line with **SLAuS 701**, could be:

1.  **Significant Management Judgement Involved:** Both inventory valuation (especially NRV assessment) and trade receivables impairment (expected credit loss calculation) involve significant management judgement and estimation. KAMs often include areas with high estimation uncertainty.
2.  **Higher Risk of Material Misstatement:** The scenario explicitly states these areas involve valuation audit assertions which are considered to have a significant risk of material misstatements. Areas of higher assessed risk of material misstatement are common KAMs.
3.  **Materiality of the Balances:** Debtors and inventory often represent substantial portions of a company's assets. The problem notes that trade debtors are 10 times performance materiality, and inventory is also significant (though not explicitly quantified against total assets in the snippet for Q5, it's implied by being a KAM). The importance of these balances to users' understanding makes them candidates for KAMs.
4.  **Complexity and Subjectivity of Underlying Accounting Policies:** The calculation of expected credit losses for receivables and determining the net realizable value for inventory can involve complex methodologies and subjective inputs. For instance, the management of AX PLC applied inappropriate assumptions for ECL. The complexity or subjectivity in applying accounting policies is a factor in identifying KAMs.
5.  **Audit Effort and Misstatements Identified:** The identification of significant misstatements in both areas (Rs. 3 million for receivables impairment and Rs. 2 million for inventory understatement) indicates these were areas requiring significant audit attention and effort to address. The nature and extent of audit effort is a consideration for KAMs.

## SECTION 3

### Question 06

> High Tea PLC (HTP) is a plantation company that owns tea plantations and produces tea that is sold by way of export to a number of foreign countries. HTP owns 25 tea estates, and each estate has large trees that are used for timber which are actively managed to maximize growth and ensure sustainable harvesting practices. These trees are recorded in the statement of financial position and classified as biological assets as they can be sold for timber.
>
> In 2024, HTP faced significant financial challenges due to a downturn in the export market, resulting in a 25% decline in overall revenue from the sale of tea. The loss of a key market that contributed to 40% of HTP's revenue has pressured the management to adopt aggressive sales strategies to explore new markets. Due to cash flow constraints, the company had defaulted on some of its short-term export credit loans.
>
> Given that the management's compensation is directly tied to the revenue and profitability of the company, there are concerns about the potential manipulation of financial results by the senior management to meet profit targets. In the past, the external auditor has found that the management had overstated revenue by prematurely recognising sales without considering the applicable sales terms for exports. It was also noted that each sales consignment is high in value and depends on contracted terms. A misstatement in one sales invoice can have a significant impact on sales. While the management agreed to implement controls over the year-end sales cut-off, the effectiveness of these controls could be compromised by the senior management as there is pressure to achieve financial goals, raising the risk of management override of controls.
>
> The valuation of biological assets relating to trees require significant assumptions and judgements. In the previous year, the management restated its financial statements due to errors in the number of trees used for timber valuation as well as mistakes made in the key assumptions. This indicates potential weaknesses in the valuation methods and assumptions currently applied to both tea and timber inventories.
>
> As at 31 March 2024, inventory levels for tea had increased significantly (recorded at cost) amounting to ten times the materiality threshold set by the external auditor. The ageing of the inventory indicated that some inventory had not moved for six months. Recent quality audits revealed discrepancies in quality and grading of tea that could further affect the valuations of inventory. The finished goods inventory comprises manufactured tea ready for export. The provision for inventory is also above the performance materiality.
>
> HTP has an established internal audit department that reports directly to the board audit committee on a quarterly basis. The internal audit team engages in separate discussions with the external auditor twice a year. During these discussions, it was noted that no frauds had occurred during the period.
>
> The external auditor is in the process of finalising the audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024, and has identified two significant risks to be considered.
> (i) Fraud in revenue recognition; and
> (ii) Management override of controls
>
> At the end of the external audit, the external auditor noted that the revenue for the year ended 31 March 2024 was misstated due to a cut-off error. The misstatement was above the performance materiality and exceeded the overall materiality by 10%. The management was not willing to correct the misstatement as they believed that revenue was recorded per the amounts invoiced. The board audit committee was in agreement with the management.

**(a) Question:** Assess the reasons for the external auditor to identify the two significant risks mentioned in the scenario above. (5 marks)
**Answer:**
The external auditor identified "Fraud in revenue recognition" and "Management override of controls" as significant risks for HTP for the year ended 31 March 2024 due to the following reasons:

**1. Fraud in Revenue Recognition:**
-   **Presumption of Fraud Risk in Revenue Recognition (SLAuS 240):** Auditing standards presume that there are risks of fraud in revenue recognition, which can only be rebutted in specific circumstances. Given HTP's situation, rebutting this presumption is unlikely.
-   **Past History of Misstatement:** Management had previously overstated revenue by prematurely recognizing sales without considering applicable export sales terms. Past misstatements increase the risk of similar issues recurring.
-   **Pressure on Management:** There is significant pressure on management to achieve financial goals due to the 25% decline in overall revenue, loss of a key market (40% of revenue), and management compensation being tied to revenue and profitability. This provides a strong incentive to manipulate revenue.
-   **High Value and Contract-Dependent Sales:** Each sales consignment is high in value and depends on contracted terms, meaning a single misstatement can have a significant impact. This makes revenue susceptible to material misstatement through fraudulent manipulation of individual contracts or recognition timing.
-   **Aggressive Sales Strategies:** The pressure to explore new markets with aggressive sales strategies might lead to recognizing revenue from uncertain new customers or on terms that do not meet recognition criteria.

**2. Management Override of Controls:**
-   **Inherent Risk (SLAuS 240):** Management override of controls is considered a significant risk in every audit due to management's unique position to manipulate accounting records and prepare fraudulent financial statements by overriding controls that otherwise appear to be operating effectively. This risk cannot be rebutted.
-   **Pressure to Achieve Financial Goals:** As mentioned above, the significant financial challenges, revenue decline, and compensation tied to performance create intense pressure on senior management to meet targets. This pressure increases the likelihood of management overriding internal controls, such as those recently agreed for sales cut-off, to achieve desired financial results.
-   **Past Behavior:** The previous instance of overstating revenue suggests a potential willingness or environment where controls could be bypassed or overridden by management to manipulate results.
-   **Control Effectiveness Compromised:** Even if management agreed to implement controls over year-end sales cut-off, the effectiveness is stated to be potentially compromised by senior management due to the pressure to achieve financial goals. This directly points to the risk of controls being overridden.

**(b) Question:** Assess three (03) risks of material misstatement arising from events or information available other than the significant risks already identified for HTP for the year ended 31 March 2024. (6 marks)
**Answer:**
Three additional risks of material misstatement for HTP are:

1.  **Risk of Material Misstatement in Inventory Valuation (Accuracy, Valuation, and Allocation):**
    **Reason:** Inventory levels for tea have increased significantly (ten times materiality threshold) and some inventory is slow-moving (not moved for six months). Recent quality audits also revealed discrepancies in quality and grading. This indicates a high risk that the inventory is not valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value (NRV) as required by **LKAS 2**, leading to overstatement. The provision for inventory is already above performance materiality, suggesting existing valuation concerns. The downturn in the export market further exacerbates this risk as NRV might have fallen below cost.
2.  **Risk of Material Misstatement in Valuation of Biological Assets (Accuracy, Valuation, and Allocation):**
    **Reason:** The valuation of biological assets (timber trees) requires significant assumptions and judgments. In the previous year, HTP restated its financial statements due to errors in tree numbers and key assumptions used in this valuation. This indicates potential weaknesses in current valuation methods. Given the financial challenges and pressure on management, there's a risk they might use biased or overly optimistic assumptions to inflate asset values and profitability.
3.  **Risk of Inappropriate Going Concern Assumption or Inadequate Disclosure of Material Uncertainty:**
    **Reason:** HTP faced significant financial challenges including a 25% revenue decline, loss of a key market (40% of revenue), and defaulted on short-term loans due to cash flow constraints. These are strong indicators of potential going concern issues as per **SLAuS 570**. There is a risk that the going concern basis of accounting may not be appropriate, or, if it is, that a material uncertainty exists which requires adequate disclosure in the financial statements. Management, under pressure, might be reluctant to make such disclosures or to prepare accounts on an alternative basis if necessary.

**(c) Question:** Outline two (02) audit procedures the external auditor could perform to test the valuation of finished goods inventory category as at 31 March 2024. (4 marks)
**Answer:**
Two audit procedures the external auditor could perform to test the valuation (specifically lower of cost and net realizable value - NRV) of HTP's finished goods (tea) inventory are:

1.  **Test Costing of Finished Goods:**
    Select a sample of manufactured tea items from the year-end inventory valuation. For these items, verify the unit cost by examining supporting documentation for the components of cost:
    -   Raw materials (tea leaves): Trace costs back to purchase invoices or standard cost records, ensuring these reflect actual costs.
    -   Other direct costs (e.g., labor, direct manufacturing expenses): Trace to payroll records and overhead allocation schedules.
    -   Production overheads: Review the basis for overhead absorption to ensure it is reasonable, based on normal activity levels, and consistently applied, excluding any abnormal wastage or inefficiencies.
2.  **Test Net Realizable Value (NRV) and Compare with Cost:**
    For a sample of finished tea inventory items (particularly those identified as slow-moving or with quality issues), ascertain their NRV. This involves:
    -   Examining post year-end sales invoices to determine actual selling prices achieved for similar grades of tea.
    -   For unsold items, inspect current price lists, export contracts, or market price data for tea, considering the impact of the downturn in the export market.
    -   Deducting estimated costs to sell (e.g., export costs, commissions) from the estimated selling price to arrive at NRV.
    -   Compare the determined NRV for each sampled item with its recorded cost and ensure that inventory is written down to NRV where NRV is lower than cost. Evaluate the adequacy of any provision made by management for obsolete or slow-moving stock.

**(d) Question:** Analyse the financial statement impact of the unadjusted misstatement in revenue on the audit report of HTP for the year ended 31 March 2024. (5 marks)
**Answer:**
The unadjusted misstatement in revenue due to a cut-off error, which is above performance materiality and exceeds overall materiality by 10%, will have the following impact on the financial statements and the audit report:

**Financial Statement Impact:** Revenue for the year ended 31 March 2024 will be overstated. Consequently, profit before tax and related balances like retained earnings and potentially trade receivables (if sales were on credit and recognized prematurely) will also be overstated. This leads to the financial statements not presenting a true and fair view (or not being fairly presented in all material respects).

**Impact on Audit Report:**
-   **Material Misstatement:** The auditor has concluded that the financial statements are materially misstated because the revenue cut-off error exceeds overall materiality. Management and the audit committee are unwilling to correct this misstatement.
-   **Pervasiveness Assessment:** The auditor needs to determine if the effect of this material misstatement is pervasive to the financial statements.
    -   **If the misstatement, although exceeding overall materiality by 10%, is considered material but not pervasive** (i.e., it's significant but its effects are confined to specific elements like revenue and profit, and doesn't fundamentally mislead users about the overall financial position and performance, or represent a substantial portion of the financial statements), the auditor will issue a **Qualified Opinion**. The opinion paragraph would state that "except for the effects of the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section, the financial statements present fairly..." The Basis for Qualified Opinion section would describe the cut-off error and quantify its impact on revenue and profit.
    -   **If the misstatement is considered material and pervasive** (e.g., if revenue is a primary driver of many key ratios and investor decisions for HTP, and its overstatement by an amount significantly exceeding materiality distorts the overall financial picture to such an extent that the financial statements as a whole are misleading), the auditor will issue an **Adverse Opinion**. An adverse opinion states that the financial statements do not present fairly (or do not give a true and fair view). The Basis for Adverse Opinion section would explain the nature and quantification of the revenue misstatement and its pervasive impact.
-   **Communication:** Regardless of the type of modification, the auditor must communicate with those charged with governance (the board audit committee) regarding the uncorrected misstatement and the intended modification to the audit report.

Given the information that the misstatement "exceeded the overall materiality by 10%", it is a significant amount. While a 10% excess over materiality might often lead to a qualified opinion, if revenue is the most critical figure for HTP and this misstatement fundamentally distorts the understanding of the company's performance, an adverse opinion could be considered. However, typically, unless the misstatement represents a very substantial portion or affects numerous accounts pervasively, a qualified opinion is more common for a single, quantifiable misstatement of this nature. The scenario implies it's a single cut-off error, which usually leads to a qualified opinion unless its impact is exceptionally distorting.

### Question 07

> Rainbow PLC (RPLC) imports and sells household electrical equipment locally and owns subsidiaries manufacturing home furniture for local sales. A new group chief executive officer (GCEO) and two general managers were appointed to oversee sales and finance in order to revamp the group's businesses, especially sales and marketing. The group has a good track record and adequately remunerates the key management for their performance, which is linked to the achievement of revenue and profit targets.
>
> However, due to the economic situation in Sri Lanka, the group has encountered many operational issues that have deteriorated its financial position. These are noted below.
>
> (i) Warranty claims:
> New washing machines sold with a 3-year warranty during the last two financial years had technical defects and customers are claiming the warranty. The foreign manufacturer does not cover these claims. Therefore, the warranty claims computed using a calculation method are recorded in the general ledger as payables, as and when the claims are received (and this has been a regular practice in the previous years).
> (ii) Consignment sales
> Dishwashers sold on consignment to a supermarket chain account for 13% of total group sales. Errors have been identified in reversing consignment stocks against revenue recorded using proforma invoices.
> (iii) Inventory obsolescence
> Refrigerators and microwaves nearing technical obsolescence are priced 25% below cost. Management has not recognized a provision, citing consistent practice over the past three years. Inventory valuation was identified as a significant risk in the prior audit.
> (iv) Trade debtors:
> The trade debtors balance comprises supermarkets, dealers, and distributors, who are all spread across Sri Lanka. The standard credit period is 60 days, and all sales are made on credit. The trade debtors balance is 10 times the performance materiality.
>
> The group was audited by T&T Associates (T&T), a firm of chartered accountants, until the financial year ended 31 March 2023. An unmodified audit opinion for the financial year ended 31 March 2023 was issued by T&T on 23 October 2023. CeDa Associates (CD), a firm of chartered accountants, was appointed as the new external auditor, and you are the audit manager in the audit team that is performing the initial audit of the group.
>
> As this is an initial audit for CD, the audit team plans to meet the prior year auditor to perform the verification of opening balances. You have now commenced the audit of the financial year ended 31 March 2024. You have decided to call confirmations from trade debtors as an audit procedure, using a sample of 75 trade debtors. You have not received any response from 12 trade debtors, whilst 45 confirmations received from trade debtors contained discrepancies between the amount confirmed and the amount recorded in the debtor's ledger.

**(a) Question:** Assess the reliability of calling debtor confirmations and determine the appropriate next steps to address the non-responses and discrepancies in the confirmations received. (6 marks)
**Answer:**
**Assessing Reliability of Debtor Confirmations:**
Debtor confirmations, when properly controlled and responded to, are generally considered reliable audit evidence because they come directly from an independent third party. However, the reliability in this specific case for RPLC is currently diminished by:

-   **High Discrepancy Rate:** 45 out of (75-12=63) responses received contained discrepancies, which is a very high rate (45/63 ≈ 71%). This indicates potential issues with RPLC's records, customer records, or the confirmation process itself, and reduces the reliability of the confirmations as straightforward evidence.
-   **Non-Response Rate:** 12 out of 75 debtors did not respond (16% non-response rate). For these, no direct confirmation evidence has been obtained.
-   **Electronic Confirmations (if used):** If electronic confirmations were used, their reliability depends on the validation of the respondent's identity and the security of the transmission process. The scenario does not specify, but this is a general consideration.

**Appropriate Next Steps:**

**For Non-Responses (12 debtors):**
As per **SLAuS 505**, for non-responses to positive confirmation requests, the auditor shall perform alternative audit procedures. CD Associates should:

-   **Send Second Requests:** If not already done, send second confirmation requests to the 12 non-responding debtors. It might also be appropriate, with RPLC's permission, to follow up with a phone call to encourage a response.
-   **Perform Alternative Procedures:** For any remaining non-responses after follow-ups, CD Associates must perform alternative procedures to obtain relevant and reliable audit evidence regarding the existence and accuracy of these debtor balances. These include:
    -   **Checking Subsequent Cash Receipts:** Examine post year-end bank statements and remittance advices to see if these debtors have paid their balances after the year-end.
    -   **Examining Supporting Documentation:** Verify the validity of the outstanding balances by inspecting underlying documents such as customer sales orders, dispatch notes (GDNs), and signed delivery acknowledgements, and sales invoices.
    -   **Reviewing Customer Correspondence:** Inspect correspondence files for any disputes or issues that might explain the non-response or affect recoverability.

**For Confirmations with Discrepancies (45 debtors):**
All discrepancies must be investigated to determine if they represent misstatements. CD Associates should:

-   **Reconcile and Investigate:** Request RPLC management to investigate and reconcile each of the 45 discrepancies. The audit team should review these reconciliations.
-   **Identify Reasons for Discrepancies:** Common reasons include:
    -   Goods/Cash in Transit: Goods dispatched by RPLC but not yet received by the customer, or payments made by the customer but not yet received/recorded by RPLC. These usually do not require adjustment if cut-off is correct but need verification.
    -   Disputed Amounts: Disagreements over quantity, quality, pricing, or returns. These may indicate a need for an allowance for doubtful debts or a sales adjustment.
    -   Client Errors: Incorrect postings, unrecorded credit notes, or other errors in RPLC's accounting records.
    -   Customer Errors: Errors in the customer's records.
-   **Quantify Misstatements:** If discrepancies are found to be misstatements due to errors by RPLC, these should be quantified and aggregated to assess their overall impact on the financial statements.
-   **Consider Implications for Internal Controls:** The high number of discrepancies might indicate weaknesses in RPLC's sales, invoicing, or receivables management processes, which may require the audit team to reassess control risk and potentially increase other substantive testing.

Given the high rate of discrepancies and non-responses, CD Associates must meticulously follow up and document all findings and may need to consider extending the sample or performing more extensive alternative procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence for the trade debtors balance.

**(b) Question:** Explain the objectives of the opening balances review to be performed during the initial audit. (2 marks)
**Answer:**
In an initial audit engagement for RPLC, the objectives of the auditor (CD Associates) regarding opening balances, as per **SLAuS 510**, are to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence about whether:

1.  Opening balances contain misstatements that materially affect the current period's (year ended 31 March 2024) financial statements. This involves ensuring that the prior period's closing balances have been correctly brought forward or, if necessary, restated.
2.  Appropriate accounting policies reflected in the opening balances have been consistently applied in the current period's financial statements, or changes thereto are properly accounted for and adequately presented and disclosed in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.

**(c) Question:** Outline two (02) areas that the audit team should discuss with the prior year auditor during the opening balances review. (5 marks)
> *(The suggested solution refers to 5 marks but seems to list more than 2 points. I will provide two distinct, substantial areas as requested by the question, drawing from the list in the solution.)*
**Answer:**
During the opening balances review for RPLC, when CD Associates meets with the prior year auditor (T&T Associates), two key areas they should discuss are:

1.  **Significant Risks, Misstatements, and Accounting Issues from Prior Audit:**
    -   CD Associates should inquire about any significant risks identified by T&T in the prior year audit (year ended 31 March 2023), particularly concerning areas like inventory valuation (which was a significant risk), consignment sales revenue recognition, and warranty provisions. They should discuss the audit procedures T&T performed in these areas and their findings.
    -   They should ask about any corrected and uncorrected misstatements identified by T&T in the previous year, understanding their nature and the reasons they were uncorrected (if applicable). This is crucial for assessing if these could impact the opening balances or have a continuing effect in the current year.
    -   Discussions should also cover any complex or contentious accounting issues encountered by T&T, the accounting treatments adopted by RPLC, and T&T's concurrence with those treatments, especially for the warranty provision calculation method and consignment sales accounting.
2.  **Prior Year Auditor's Understanding of Internal Controls and Communications with Management/Those Charged with Governance:**
    -   CD Associates should seek to understand T&T's assessment of RPLC's internal control environment and specific controls relevant to financial reporting in the prior year.
    -   They should inquire about any significant control deficiencies or accounting issues communicated by T&T to RPLC's management or those charged with governance, and management's responses to those communications. This helps CD Associates assess the reliability of the systems that produced the opening balances and identify areas that might require more attention in the current audit.

**(d) Question:** Explain two (02) audit procedures the audit team should perform on warranty provisions. (4 marks)
**Answer:**
Two audit procedures the audit team (CD Associates) should perform on RPLC's warranty provisions are:

1.  **Review the Basis and Calculation of the Provision:**
    -   Obtain and review management's calculation method for the warranty provision. Assess the reasonableness of the assumptions used by management, such as the expected rate of warranty claims based on historical data for the new washing machines with technical defects, estimated cost per claim, and the warranty period (3 years).
    -   Compare the current year's claim rates and costs with historical data and industry averages, if available. Recalculate a sample of provision components to check arithmetical accuracy. The auditor should also compare the actual claims experienced in the current year (and post year-end) against the provisions made in the prior year to assess the historical accuracy of management's estimation process.
2.  **Inspect Supporting Documentation and Inquire about Terms:**
    -   Inspect the sales agreements and warranty terms for the new washing machines to understand the company's obligations.
    -   Review correspondence with customers regarding warranty claims and also inquire with management about any significant individual claims or patterns of defects that might necessitate a larger provision than calculated using historical rates, especially since the foreign manufacturer does not cover these claims.

**(e) Question:** Outline one (01) matter that should be mentioned in the 'other matter paragraph' to be included in the audit opinion. (3 marks)
**Answer:**
One matter that should be mentioned in an 'Other Matter paragraph' in CD Associates' audit report for RPLC for the year ended 31 March 2024 is related to the fact that the comparative financial statements (for the year ended 31 March 2023) were audited by a predecessor auditor.

The Other Matter paragraph would typically state:

-   That the financial statements of RPLC for the preceding period (year ended 31 March 2023) were audited by another auditor (T&T Associates).
-   The type of opinion expressed by the predecessor auditor (in this case, an unmodified audit opinion) and, if the opinion was modified, the reasons therefor.
-   The date of the predecessor auditor's report (23 October 2023).

This provides context to the users of the financial statements regarding the audit of the comparative information, as required by **SLAuS 710**. An Other Matter paragraph is appropriate because this information is relevant to users' understanding of the audit and the auditor's responsibilities but is not presented or disclosed in the financial statements themselves.
