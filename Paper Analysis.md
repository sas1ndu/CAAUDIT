# CA Sri Lanka CL1 Auditing Paper Analysis (Dec 2020 - June 2024) - Concept-wise Marks

I have performed a detailed concept-wise analysis with approximate mark values for each CA Sri Lanka CL1 Auditing paper from December 2020 to June 2024, based on the provided question papers and suggested solutions.

## Methodology for Mark Allocation:

* **MCQs (Section 1):** Each of the 10 MCQs is allocated 2 marks, totaling 20 marks. Marks are assigned to the primary concept tested by each MCQ.
* **Structured Questions (Sections 2 & 3):** These sections total 80 marks.
    * Section 2 typically has 4 questions of 10 marks each (or 5 questions as seen in older papers).
    * Section 3 typically has 2 questions of 20 marks each.
* Marks for sub-parts of questions were derived from the suggested solutions where breakdowns were apparent, or estimated based on the depth of the answer required and the relative weighting of the concepts within the question.
* **Concept Categories:** The categorization is based on the primary focus of the question/sub-question. Some questions might have overlapping concepts; in such cases, the marks are attributed to the most dominant concept.
* **Approximation:** The mark values for concepts within structured questions are approximate, as the official marking schemes might have more granular breakdowns. However, this analysis reflects the thematic weightage.

Below are the tables for each exam sitting, organized by year:

## Key Observations from the Mark Value Analysis:

* **Audit Reporting** consistently carries very high marks in structured questions, often involving multiple aspects like opinion modification, KAMs, and going concern implications.
* **Professional Ethics & Independence** is a staple, with significant marks in both MCQs and dedicated structured questions.
* **Technology in Audit & Cybersecurity** has a strong presence in MCQs and is increasingly integrated into structured questions, particularly concerning data analytics and IT controls.
* **Risk Assessment & Response** and **Audit Evidence & Procedures** form the bulk of the technical audit content in structured questions, often tested together. Procedures for specific accounts like inventory, receivables, and provisions are common.
* **Going Concern** assessment and its reporting impact are frequently tested with substantial mark allocations.
* **Internal Controls** (including IT controls) and their weaknesses are regularly examined, often requiring management letter-style responses.
* **Quality Management (SLSQM 1)** is appearing more frequently and with higher marks, especially in structured questions.
* **Other Assurance Engagements** (Reviews, AUPs, PFIs) and **Internal Audit** are consistent, moderately weighted topics.

This detailed breakdown should help in prioritizing study areas based on their consistent weightage and frequency in the CL1 Advanced Audit & Assurance exams.
