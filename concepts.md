# CA Sri Lanka CL1 Advanced Audit and Assurance: Key Concepts by Chapter

## Volume I

### Chapter 1: Introduction to External Audit
-   **Assurance Engagement:** An engagement where a practitioner expresses a conclusion designed to enhance the degree of confidence of intended users (other than the responsible party) about the outcome of the evaluation or measurement of a subject matter against criteria.
-   **Accountability, Stewardship, and Agency:** These concepts highlight the relationship where directors (agents) are responsible for managing the company's assets on behalf of shareholders (principals) and are accountable for their actions, necessitating an independent audit.
-   **Elements of an Assurance Engagement (CREST):** The five core components are: Suitable Criteria, a written assurance Report, sufficient appropriate Evidence, an appropriate Subject matter, and a Three-party relationship (practitioner, responsible party, intended users).
-   **Levels of Assurance:** Assurance engagements can provide either reasonable assurance (high, but not absolute, assurance, e.g., an audit) or limited assurance (a lower level of assurance, e.g., a review).
-   **Objective of an External Audit:** To obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, enabling the auditor to express an opinion on their fairness.
-   **The Audit Opinion:** The auditor's formal expression on whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework (e.g., "give a true and fair view").
-   **Reasonable Assurance:** A high, but not absolute, level of assurance meaning the financial statements are free from material misstatement. It acknowledges the inherent limitations of an audit.
-   **Inherent Limitations of Audit:** Factors such as the use of judgment, sampling, the inherent limitations of internal control, and the fact that much audit evidence is persuasive rather than conclusive, mean an audit cannot provide absolute certainty.
-   **Materiality:** An expression of the relative significance or importance of a matter in the context of the financial statements as a whole; a matter is material if its omission or misstatement could influence users' economic decisions.
-   **Regulation of Auditors in Sri Lanka:** The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) formulates Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs), and the Sri Lanka Accounting & Auditing Standards Monitoring Board (SLAASMB) monitors compliance by Specified Business Enterprises.
-   **Specified Business Enterprises (SBEs):** Entities defined by the Sri Lanka Accounting and Auditing Standards Act that are required to have their financial statements audited, including companies licensed under various acts (e.g., Banking Act, Securities and Exchange Commission Act) and other companies meeting certain turnover, equity, asset, liability, or employee thresholds.
-   **Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs):** Based on International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) issued by the IAASB, these must be followed by auditors in Sri Lanka.
-   **True and Fair View:** This means the financial statements are factual, free from bias, and reflect the commercial substance of the business's transactions.
-   **Stakeholders:** Various parties interested in a company's accounts, including directors, shareholders, employees, tax authorities, the public, and creditors, who gain assurance from an independent audit report.
-   **Review Engagement:** A type of assurance engagement providing a limited level of assurance, where the practitioner expresses a negative conclusion (e.g., "nothing has come to our attention...").

### Chapter 2: Introduction to Internal Control
-   **Internal Control:** A process designed, implemented, and maintained by those charged with governance, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance about the achievement of an entity's objectives regarding reliability of financial reporting, effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
-   **COSO Framework:** A widely accepted framework that breaks internal controls into five components: Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Control Activities, Information & Communication, and Monitoring Activities, along with 17 principles.
-   **Control Environment:** The set of standards, processes, and structures that provide the basis for carrying out internal control across the organization; it includes the governance and management functions and the attitudes, awareness, and actions of those in charge regarding internal control.
-   **Entity's Risk Assessment Process:** The auditor must understand if and how the entity identifies business risks relevant to financial reporting, estimates their significance, assesses their likelihood, and decides on actions to address them.
-   **Information System Relevant to Financial Reporting:** Includes the financial reporting system and consists of procedures and records established to initiate, record, process, and report entity transactions and to maintain accountability for related assets, liabilities, and equity.
-   **Control Activities:** Policies and procedures that help ensure management directives are carried out, designed to prevent or detect and correct errors and fraud. Examples include performance reviews, information processing controls, physical controls, and segregation of duties.
-   **Segregation of Duties:** Assigning different people the responsibilities of authorizing transactions, recording transactions, and maintaining custody of assets to reduce opportunities for errors and fraud.
-   **Monitoring of Controls:** A process to assess the effectiveness of internal control performance over time, including assessing the design and operation of controls and taking corrective actions.
-   **Internal Controls in Small Companies:** Often less formal and reliant on the close involvement of directors or proprietors, which can also be a limitation due to the potential for management override.
-   **Inherent Limitations of Internal Control:** Factors such as the cost of control not outweighing benefits, human error, collusion, management override, and controls being designed for routine transactions mean internal control can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance.
-   **Recording Accounting and Control Systems:** Auditors document their understanding of systems using methods like narrative notes, questionnaires (ICQs/ICEQs), flowcharts, or checklists.
-   **Walk-through Tests:** Procedures involving tracing a few transactions through the financial reporting system to confirm the auditor's understanding of the system design and that controls have been implemented.
-   **Tests of Controls:** Audit procedures designed to evaluate the operating effectiveness of controls in preventing, or detecting and correcting, material misstatements at the assertion level.
-   **General IT Controls:** Policies and procedures that relate to many applications and support the effective functioning of application controls (e.g., controls over data centers, system software acquisition, access security).
-   **Application Controls:** Manual or automated procedures that typically operate at a business process level to ensure the integrity of accounting records (e.g., controls over input, processing, and output of data).

### Chapter 3: Internal Controls Over Specific Business Areas
-   **Order-to-Receipt Cycle (Sales System) Controls:** Key control objectives focus on ensuring sales are genuine, complete, accurately recorded, correctly priced, and made to creditworthy customers.
-   **Sales System - Occurrence and Existence Controls:** Include segregation of duties, authorization of credit terms, and matching sales orders with dispatch documentation.
-   **Sales System - Completeness Controls:** Ensuring all revenue for goods dispatched is recorded, often through numerical sequencing of invoices and matching dispatch documents to sales invoices.
-   **Sales System - Accuracy Controls:** Verifying that sales are correctly journalized, summarized, and posted, using authorized price lists and checking calculations.
-   **Sales System - Cut-off Controls:** Ensuring transactions are recorded in the correct period, often by daily invoicing of goods shipped and comparing dates on invoices with dispatch documents.
-   **Procurement-to-Pay Cycle (Purchases System) Controls:** Objectives center on ensuring purchases are authorized, represent goods/services received, are completely and accurately recorded, and relate to the entity's obligations.
-   **Purchases System - Occurrence and Existence Controls:** Include authorization procedures for ordering, segregation of duties, and matching purchase orders and GRNs with suppliers' invoices.
-   **Purchases System - Completeness Controls:** Ensuring all purchase transactions are recorded, often through reconciliation of supplier statements and accounting for pre-numbered GRNs and purchase orders.
-   **Purchases System - Accuracy, Valuation, and Allocation Controls:** Verifying the mathematical accuracy of supplier invoices and ensuring amounts are posted correctly to the general and purchases ledgers.
-   **Payroll Cycle Controls:** Key objectives are to ensure payment is made only to bona fide employees for work done, gross pay and deductions are calculated correctly, and payroll costs are accurately recorded.
-   **Payroll System - Occurrence and Existence Controls:** Segregation of duties between HR and payroll, authorization procedures for hiring/terminating and wage rates, and use of time clocks.
-   **Control Over Cash Management (Payments & Receipts):** Objectives aim to ensure only valid payments are made and all valid receipts are received and deposited, with accurate recording and proper cut-off.
-   **Inventory Controls Objectives:** Ensuring all inventory movements are authorized and recorded, inventory physically exists and belongs to the entity, and is accurately valued at the lower of cost and NRV with correct cut-off.
-   **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) Controls:** Focusing on authorization of acquisitions and disposals, correct classification of capital vs. revenue expenditure, and maintaining an accurate non-current asset register.
-   **Capital vs. Revenue Expenditure Controls:** Ensuring a clear distinction is made, with capital expenditure enhancing economic benefits or restoring components, and revenue expenditure relating to repairs and maintenance.

### Chapter 4: Agreeing Terms and Risk Assessment
-   **Preconditions for an Audit:** Management's use of an acceptable financial reporting framework and their agreement to the premise on which an audit is conducted (including responsibilities for financial statements, internal control, and providing access to information).
-   **Audit Engagement Letter:** A written agreement recording the terms of the audit engagement, including the objective and scope of the audit, and the responsibilities of both the auditor and management.
-   **Recurring Audits - Revising Terms:** Assessing if engagement terms need revision due to factors like entity misunderstanding, changes in management, ownership, business nature/size, or legal/reporting frameworks.
-   **Acceptance of a Change in Terms:** An auditor should not agree to change terms without reasonable justification, especially if it seems to relate to avoiding a modified opinion due to inability to obtain sufficient evidence.
-   **Overall Objectives of the Auditor (SLAuS 200):** To obtain reasonable assurance that financial statements are free from material misstatement (fraud or error) and to report findings.
-   **Professional Scepticism:** An attitude including a questioning mind, being alert to conditions indicating possible misstatement, and a critical assessment of audit evidence.
-   **Professional Judgement:** The application of relevant training, knowledge, and experience in making informed decisions about appropriate courses of action during an audit.
-   **Audit Risk:** The risk that the auditor expresses an inappropriate audit opinion when the financial statements are materially misstated.
-   **Components of Audit Risk:** Audit Risk = Inherent Risk × Control Risk × Detection Risk.
-   **Inherent Risk:** The susceptibility of an assertion to a material misstatement before considering any related controls, influenced by the nature of the entity and its items.
-   **Control Risk:** The risk that a material misstatement that could occur in an assertion will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis by the entity's internal control.
-   **Detection Risk:** The risk that the auditor's procedures will not detect a material misstatement that exists. Auditors manage this through the nature, timing, and extent of their work.
-   **Materiality for Financial Statements as a Whole:** Determining a level (often a percentage of a benchmark like profit before tax or total assets) above which misstatements would influence users' economic decisions.
-   **Performance Materiality:** An amount set by the auditor at less than materiality for the financial statements as a whole to reduce the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality.
-   **Understanding the Entity and its Environment (SLAuS 315):** A crucial step to identify and assess risks of material misstatement by examining industry factors, entity nature, accounting policies, objectives, strategies, financial performance, and internal control.

### Chapter 5: Audit Planning
-   **Importance of Planning (SLAuS 300):** Ensures the audit is performed effectively, helps devote attention to important areas, identifies potential problems timely, assists in team selection and work assignment, and facilitates direction, supervision, and review.
-   **Overall Audit Strategy:** Sets the scope, timing, and direction of the audit and guides the development of the detailed audit plan. It considers engagement characteristics, reporting objectives, and significant factors.
-   **Audit Plan:** Converts the audit strategy into a detailed plan, including the nature, timing, and extent of planned risk assessment procedures and further audit procedures at the assertion level.
-   **Updating Audit Strategy and Plan:** Both the overall audit strategy and the detailed audit plan must be updated and changed as necessary during the course of the audit if circumstances change or new information emerges.
-   **Interim Audit:** Audit work performed during the period under review, before the year-end, often focusing on risk assessment, documenting and testing internal controls, and some limited substantive procedures.
-   **Final Audit:** Audit work performed after the year-end, concentrating on substantive procedures for year-end balances, subsequent events review, and forming the audit opinion.
-   **Timing of Substantive Procedures:** Higher risk areas are more likely to have substantive procedures performed nearer to, or at, the period-end rather than earlier.
-   **Impact of Interim Controls Testing on Final Audit:** If interim testing shows controls are effective, the final audit can focus on changes to controls and the remaining period, potentially reducing substantive testing.
-   **Impact of Interim Substantive Procedures on Final Audit:** If substantive procedures are done at an interim date, the auditor must cover the remaining period with further substantive procedures or a combination of substantive procedures and tests of controls for the intervening period.
-   **Group Audits (SLAuS 600) - Auditor's Objectives:** To determine whether to act as group auditor and, if so, to communicate clearly with component auditors and obtain sufficient appropriate evidence on components and the consolidation process.
-   **Group Engagement Partner Responsibility:** Responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the group audit engagement and the appropriateness of the audit report.
-   **Component Auditor:** An auditor who, at the request of the group engagement team, performs work on financial information related to a component for the group audit.
-   **Significant Component:** A component identified by the group engagement team as being of individual financial significance to the group or likely to include significant risks of material misstatement.
-   **Component Materiality:** The materiality level for a component determined by the group engagement team, which must be lower than materiality for the group financial statements as a whole.
-   **Understanding and Evaluating Component Auditors:** The group engagement team must understand the component auditor's independence, competence, likely involvement of the group team in their work, and their regulatory environment.

### Chapter 6: The Auditor's Responsibilities in Relation to Fraud, Laws and Regulations
-   **Auditor's Expert (SLAuS 620):** An individual or organization with expertise in a field other than accounting or auditing, whose work is used by the auditor to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence (e.g., valuers, actuaries).

-   **Statistical vs. Non-Statistical Sampling:** Statistical sampling involves random selection and probability theory to evaluate results and measure sampling risk; non-statistical sampling does not have these characteristics.
-   **Sampling Risk:** The risk that the auditor's conclusion based on a sample may be different from the conclusion if the entire population were subjected to the same audit procedure.
-   **Non-Sampling Risk:** The risk that the auditor reaches an erroneous conclusion for reasons not related to sample size (e.g., inappropriate procedures, misinterpretation of evidence).
-   **Stratification:** Dividing a population into sub-populations (strata) with similar characteristics (often monetary value) to improve audit efficiency by focusing on high-value or high-risk items.
-   **Value-Weighted Selection:** A selection method where the probability of an item being selected is proportional to its monetary value (e.g., Monetary Unit Sampling).
-   **Sample Selection Methods:**
    -   **Random Selection:** All items have an equal chance of selection (e.g., using random number generators).
    -   **Systematic Selection:** Selecting items using a constant interval between selections, after a random start.
    -   **Monetary Unit Sampling (MUS):** A type of value-weighted selection where individual currency units are sampling units.
    -   **Haphazard Selection:** Selecting items without following a structured technique, aiming for a representative sample but susceptible to unconscious bias.
    -   **Block Selection:** Selecting a block of contiguous items; rarely an appropriate sampling method as it's unlikely to be representative.
-   **Performing Audit Procedures on Selected Items:** If a selected item is not appropriate for the procedure, a replacement item is tested. If procedures cannot be applied (e.g., lost document), it's treated as a deviation/misstatement.
-   **Anomaly:** A misstatement or deviation that is demonstrably not representative of misstatements or deviations in a population (e.g., an isolated, non-recurring error).
-   **Projection of Misstatements:** For tests of details, extrapolating misstatements found in a sample to the entire population to estimate the total misstatement (anomalies are excluded from projection but considered separately).
-   **Tolerable Misstatement:** A monetary amount set by the auditor for which they seek assurance that the actual misstatement in the population does not exceed it.
-   **Tolerable Rate of Deviation:** A rate of deviation from prescribed internal control procedures set by the auditor for which they seek assurance that the actual rate in the population does not exceed it.
-   **Evaluating Sample Results:** Comparing projected misstatement (plus anomalies) to tolerable misstatement. If it exceeds, the sample doesn't provide a reasonable basis for conclusions, and further action is needed.
-   **Opening Balances (SLAuS 510):** Account balances at the beginning of the period. Auditors must obtain evidence that they do not contain material misstatements affecting the current period and that accounting policies are consistently applied.
-   **Comparative Information (SLAuS 710):** Amounts and disclosures for prior periods included in financial statements. Auditors determine if this information is required, appropriately classified, and consistent with prior period figures and current accounting policies.

### Chapter 14: Audit Review and Finalisation
-   **Related Party Transactions (SLAuS 550):** Transactions between an entity and its related parties (e.g., entities with control/significant influence, key management personnel, close family members). These carry higher risk due to potential lack of arm's length dealing and risk of fraud.
-   **Identifying Risks with Related Parties:** Requires discussion within the audit team, inquiries of management about identities and nature of relationships/transactions, and maintaining alertness for undisclosed related party transactions.
-   **Auditor's Procedures for Undisclosed/Unidentified Related Parties:** If new related parties or transactions are found, the auditor communicates this to the team, requests management to identify all transactions, inquires about control failures, performs substantive procedures, and reconsiders the risk of further undisclosed items.
-   **Arm's Length Assertion:** If management asserts related party transactions were at arm's length, the auditor must obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to support this by examining terms, prices, and credit conditions.
-   **Written Representations for Related Parties:** Auditors obtain written representations from management confirming disclosure of all known related parties and their transactions and that these have been appropriately accounted for and disclosed.
-   **Subsequent Events (LKAS 10 & SLAuS 560):** Events occurring between the date of the financial statements and the date of the auditor's report, and facts discovered after the auditor's report date.
-   **Adjusting Events:** Events providing evidence of conditions that existed at the reporting date (e.g., settlement of a court case confirming a year-end liability). Financial statements are adjusted for these.
-   **Non-Adjusting Events:** Events indicative of conditions that arose after the reporting date (e.g., a major fire destroying assets post year-end). These are disclosed if material but financial statements are not adjusted.
-   **Auditor's Responsibility for Subsequent Events (up to Report Date):** To perform procedures (inquiries, review of minutes/interim financials) to identify events requiring adjustment or disclosure.
-   **Facts Discovered After Report Date but Before FS Issue:** If a material fact becomes known, the auditor discusses with management, determines if FS need amendment, and if so, performs procedures on the amendment and issues a new report.
-   **Going Concern Assumption (LKAS 1 & SLAuS 570 Revised):** The assumption that the entity will continue in operation for the foreseeable future (at least 12 months from the reporting date). Financial statements are prepared on this basis unless liquidation is intended or there's no realistic alternative.
-   **Management's Responsibility for Going Concern Assessment:** To assess the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and disclose material uncertainties.
-   **Auditor's Procedures for Going Concern:** Evaluating management's assessment, inquiring about events beyond the assessment period, and if doubts exist, performing further procedures (e.g., reviewing cash flow forecasts, loan agreements, post-year-end results).
-   **Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern:** If a material uncertainty exists (e.g., significant doubt about ability to continue) and is adequately disclosed, the auditor issues an unmodified opinion but includes a "Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern" paragraph.
-   **Auditing Accounting Estimates (SLAuS 540):** Obtaining an understanding of how management makes estimates, evaluating the data and assumptions used, testing the process, and considering potential management bias, especially for estimates with high uncertainty (e.g., provisions, fair values).

-   **Purpose of KAMs:** To improve transparency by helping users understand the most significant issues the auditor faced, enhancing the communicative value of the report.
-   **Describing KAMs:** Each KAM description explains why the matter was considered most significant and how it was addressed in the audit, referencing related disclosures.
-   **Modified Opinions (SLAuS 705 Revised):** The auditor modifies the opinion if the financial statements as a whole are not free from material misstatement, or if sufficient appropriate audit evidence cannot be obtained.
-   **Types of Modified Opinions:** Qualified opinion, Adverse opinion, or Disclaimer of opinion, depending on the nature and pervasiveness of the matter.
-   **Pervasiveness:** Describes the effects of misstatements (or possible misstatements) that are not confined to specific elements, represent a substantial portion, or relate to disclosures fundamental to users' understanding.
-   **Qualified Opinion:** Issued when misstatements are material but not pervasive, or when the auditor cannot obtain sufficient appropriate evidence and possible effects are material but not pervasive.
-   **Adverse Opinion:** Issued when the auditor, having obtained sufficient evidence, concludes that misstatements are both material and pervasive.

### Chapter 19: Ethics and Ethical Threats
-   **CA Sri Lanka Code of Ethics:** Sets out fundamental principles and a conceptual framework for professional accountants to identify, evaluate, and address threats to compliance.
-   **Fundamental Principles of Professional Ethics:**
    -   **Integrity:** To be straightforward and honest.
    -   **Objectivity:** To not allow bias, conflict of interest, or undue influence to override professional judgments.
    -   **Professional Competence and Due Care:** To maintain knowledge and skill, and act diligently in accordance with standards.
    -   **Confidentiality:** To respect the confidentiality of information acquired, not disclosing without proper authority unless there's a legal/professional right or duty.
    -   **Professional Behaviour:** To comply with laws and regulations and avoid actions discrediting the profession.
-   **Confidentiality - Exceptions to Disclosure:** Permitted by law and authorized by client; required by law (e.g., legal proceedings); or a professional duty/right (e.g., quality review, responding to regulatory inquiry).
-   **Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations (NOCLAR):** Auditor's responsibility to alert management/those charged with governance to enable rectification or deter non-compliance, and to take further action in the public interest.
-   **Independence (of Mind and in Appearance):** Essential for objectivity. Independence of mind is the state of mind permitting an unbiased opinion. Independence in appearance is the avoidance of facts/circumstances that would lead a third party to conclude objectivity was compromised.
-   **Conceptual Framework Approach to Threats:** Identify threats, evaluate their significance, and apply safeguards to eliminate or reduce them to an acceptable level. If not possible, decline or terminate the engagement.
-   **Categories of Threats to Fundamental Principles:** Self-interest, Self-review, Advocacy, Familiarity, and Intimidation.
-   **Self-Interest Threat:** The threat that a financial or other interest will inappropriately influence judgment or behaviour (e.g., direct financial interest in a client, overdue fees, high percentage of fees from one client).
-   **Self-Review Threat:** Arises when a member reviews their own work or advice as part of an assurance engagement (e.g., preparing accounting records and then auditing them, providing valuation services included in FS).
-   **Advocacy Threat:** Occurs when the firm promotes a position or opinion to the point that subsequent objectivity is compromised (e.g., promoting shares in an audit client, acting as an advocate in litigation).
-   **Familiarity Threat:** Arises from long or close relationships with a client, where the auditor becomes too sympathetic to their interests or too accepting of their work (e.g., long association of audit partner with client).
-   **Intimidation Threat:** Occurs when members of the audit team are deterred from acting objectively by actual or perceived threats (e.g., threat of litigation by client, threat of dismissal).
-   **Safeguards Created by the Profession, Legislation, or Regulation:** Include educational requirements, CPD, corporate governance regulations, and professional standards/monitoring.
-   **Safeguards within the Firm's Systems:** Policies on leadership stressing ethics, quality control, identification/evaluation of threats, independence, using different teams for non-assurance work, and timely communication/training.
-   **Network Firms:** Firms belonging to a larger structure aimed at cooperation (e.g., sharing profits, common branding, common quality control). A network firm must be independent of audit clients of other firms in its network.

### Chapter 20: Internal Audit

-   **Independence of Internal Audit:** Internal audit should be independent of operational management whose activities they audit, typically reporting to the audit committee or board to maintain objectivity.
-   **Managing the Internal Audit Activity (IIA Standards):** The Chief Audit Executive should effectively manage the internal audit activity to ensure it adds value. This includes planning, organizing, directing, and performing internal audit activities and ensuring quality.
-   **Internal Audit Planning (Strategic, Tactical, Operational):** Developing long-term strategic plans (2-5 years identifying areas and resources), medium-term tactical plans (6 months-1 year detailing audits and objectives), and operational plans for individual audits (detailed objectives, scope, timing).
-   **Value for Money (VFM) Audits:** Examining the economy (lowest cost for inputs), efficiency (input-output relationship), and effectiveness (achieving objectives) of an organization's activities, particularly relevant for not-for-profit entities.
