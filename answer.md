# CA Sri Lanka CL1 Advanced Audit and Assurance: Example Exam Question & Answer

This example will address a common question type: Identifying and explaining audit risks from a scenario, outlining relevant audit procedures, and discussing an ethical issue.

## Hypothetical Exam Question Scenario:

You are the audit manager of "Innovate Solutions PLC" (ISPLC), a company specializing in developing and selling bespoke software solutions. ISPLC's year-end is 31 March 2024. During the planning stage, the following points have come to your attention:

* **New Revenue Stream & Recognition:** ISPLC launched a new cloud-based subscription service, "CloudSolve," in July 2023. This service involves an upfront installation fee and a monthly subscription fee. Revenue from installation is recognized upon completion of setup, and subscription revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the subscription period. This now accounts for 30% of total revenue. The sales team are heavily incentivized with bonuses based on the value of contracts signed for CloudSolve.
* **Capitalized Development Costs:** Significant costs (Rs. 25 million) associated with the internal development of CloudSolve have been capitalized as an intangible asset. Amortisation will commence once the platform is deemed fully stable and generating consistent revenue, which management expects to be from 1 April 2024.
* **Key Supplier Concerns:** ISPLC relies heavily on a single overseas supplier for a critical hardware component integrated into its traditional software solutions. Due to recent international trade tensions, there have been significant delays in component delivery, and the supplier has indicated a potential 40% price increase effective from May 2024.
* **Engagement Team Matter:** The audit senior assigned to ISPLC, Saman, mentioned that his cousin is the newly appointed (January 2024) Head of Sales for CloudSolve at ISPLC and is directly responsible for negotiating and approving new CloudSolve contracts.

### Required:

(a) Identify and explain FOUR key audit risks from the information provided above that the audit team should consider when planning the audit of Innovate Solutions PLC for the year ended 31 March 2024. For each risk, suggest ONE specific substantive audit procedure to address it. (12 marks)
(b) Discuss the ethical threats arising from Saman's relationship with the Head of Sales for CloudSolve and recommend appropriate actions the audit firm should take. (8 marks)

## Recommended Answer Pattern & Comprehensive Answer:

### (a) Key Audit Risks and Substantive Audit Procedures

The following key audit risks and corresponding substantive audit procedures have been identified for Innovate Solutions PLC for the year ended 31 March 2024:

**1. Risk: Incorrect Revenue Recognition for "CloudSolve"** (Relates to Study Text Ch. 10: Audit of Revenue and Receivables; Ch. 7: Audit Evidence; LKAS 18/SLFRS 15 concepts)

* **Explanation:**
    ISPLC has a new, material revenue stream from CloudSolve (30% of total revenue) with a complex recognition model (upfront installation fees and monthly subscriptions). Revenue from installation fees should be recognized when the service (setup) is rendered, and subscription fees over the period of service. The significant sales team bonuses based on contract value create an incentive to recognize revenue prematurely or aggressively, potentially before service obligations are fully met or over an incorrect period. This could lead to an overstatement of revenue and profit, and misstatement of receivables or deferred income.
* **Substantive Audit Procedure:**
    Select a sample of CloudSolve contracts signed during the year, particularly those near the year-end. For each, review the contract terms, installation completion evidence (e.g., customer sign-off, system logs), and verify that installation revenue was recognized only upon completion, and subscription revenue has been appropriately deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the correct subscription period.

**2. Risk: Improper Capitalisation or Valuation of Development Costs for "CloudSolve"** (Relates to Study Text Ch. 8: Auditing Non-current Assets; LKAS 38 concepts)

* **Explanation:**
    ISPLC has capitalized Rs. 25 million for the internal development of CloudSolve. According to LKAS 38 'Intangible Assets', specific criteria must be met for the capitalization of development costs (e.g., technical feasibility, intention to complete and use/sell, ability to use/sell, probable future economic benefits, availability of resources, reliable measurement of expenditure). There is a risk that costs not meeting these criteria (e.g., research costs, or costs incurred before criteria are met) have been improperly capitalized, leading to an overstatement of intangible assets and understatement of expenses. Furthermore, the decision to delay amortisation until "fully stable and generating consistent revenue" is subjective and could delay expense recognition inappropriately.
* **Substantive Audit Procedure:**
    Obtain a detailed breakdown of the capitalized development costs. For a sample of these costs, vouch to supporting documentation (e.g., employee timesheets for directly attributable labor, invoices for direct costs) and assess whether they meet the LKAS 38 capitalization criteria by reviewing project documentation, feasibility studies, management's assessment of future economic benefits, and board minutes approving the project and its continued development. Critically evaluate management's justification for the commencement date of amortisation.

**3. Risk: Going Concern Uncertainty and Inventory/Provisioning Issues due to Key Supplier Disruption** (Relates to Study Text Ch. 9: Auditing Inventory; Ch. 14: Audit Review and Finalisation - Going Concern, Provisions; LKAS 2, LKAS 37 concepts)

* **Explanation:**
    Heavy reliance on a single overseas supplier for a critical hardware component, coupled with delivery delays and a significant potential price increase, poses a threat to ISPLC's ability to deliver its traditional software solutions and maintain profitability. This could impact inventory valuation (obsolescence if components cannot be used or become too costly – LKAS 2), the need for provisions for onerous contracts if sales commitments cannot be met profitably (LKAS 37), and potentially cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern if the traditional business segment is significantly impacted (SLAuS 570).
* **Substantive Audit Procedure:**
    Review management’s assessment of the impact of the supplier issues, including their plans to mitigate the risk (e.g., identifying alternative suppliers, re-negotiating contracts, impact on sales prices). Assess the reasonableness of any provisions made for potential losses on existing sales contracts or for inventory obsolescence. Perform sensitivity analysis on cash flow forecasts considering the potential price increase and supply disruptions to evaluate the impact on the going concern assumption.

**4. Risk: Completeness and Valuation of Trade Payables and Accruals related to Supplier Issues** (Relates to Study Text Ch. 12: Liabilities, Capital and Expenses)

* **Explanation:**
    The significant potential price increase (40%) from the key overseas supplier from May 2024 (just after year-end) might lead to disputes or unrecorded liabilities if goods received before year-end are invoiced at higher prices later, or if provisions for expected price increases on committed orders are not made. This could result in an understatement of cost of sales and liabilities.
* **Substantive Audit Procedure:**
    Review post year-end invoices and payments to the key supplier to identify any invoices relating to pre-year-end deliveries that might have been recorded at incorrect amounts or omitted. Enquire with management about any purchase commitments with this supplier and assess whether any provision for onerous contracts is necessary if the expected price increase will make these commitments loss-making.

### (b) Ethical Threats and Recommended Actions from Saman's Relationship

The situation where the audit senior (Saman)'s cousin is the Head of Sales for a significant and new revenue stream (CloudSolve) at the audit client (ISPLC) raises several ethical threats as per the CA Sri Lanka Code of Ethics.

**1. Familiarity Threat:**

* **Explanation:** A close personal relationship (cousin) between Saman and a key manager at the client, particularly one in a position to influence a material area of the financial statements (CloudSolve revenue), can lead to a familiarity threat. Saman might become too sympathetic to his cousin's interests or too trusting of representations made by him, potentially impairing professional scepticism and objectivity.
* **Action:** Saman should be removed from any audit work directly related to the CloudSolve revenue stream or areas where his cousin has significant influence or responsibility. If his involvement in other areas is still significant, careful review of his work by an experienced audit manager or partner, who is aware of the relationship, is crucial.

**2. Self-Interest Threat (Potentially):**

* **Explanation:** While less direct, if Saman's cousin's remuneration or career progression is significantly tied to the success of CloudSolve, Saman might (even subconsciously) feel pressure to ensure CloudSolve's financial results appear favorable, potentially impacting his own family's indirect benefit or relationship harmony.
* **Action:** Reinforce with Saman the importance of objectivity and professional scepticism. The primary safeguard is to ensure Saman is not auditing areas directly influenced by his cousin.

**3. Intimidation Threat (Less Likely but Possible):**

* **Explanation:** In some family dynamics, the cousin (being in a senior client role) might try to unduly influence Saman regarding the audit of CloudSolve, creating an intimidation threat.
* **Action:** Open communication within the audit team and with Saman is important. If any such pressure is felt, it must be reported immediately to the engagement partner. Removing Saman from auditing this specific area mitigates this.

#### Recommended Actions by the Audit Firm:

* **Immediate Disclosure:** Saman should have disclosed this relationship to the engagement partner as soon as he became aware of his cousin's appointment or his own assignment to the audit, whichever was later.
* **Re-assignment of Duties:** Saman should be removed from auditing the CloudSolve revenue cycle and any other areas where his cousin has direct and significant influence. His responsibilities on the audit should be reassigned to another senior with equivalent experience.
* **Review of Work:** If Saman has already performed any work on areas related to CloudSolve, this work must be thoroughly and independently reviewed by another audit team member, preferably the audit manager or engagement partner.
* **Documentation:** The relationship, the threats identified, and the safeguards implemented (including the reassignment of Saman) must be documented in the audit working papers.
* **Communication with Those Charged with Governance (TCWG):** The audit firm should consider informing ISPLC's audit committee (or TCWG) about the relationship and the safeguards put in place to maintain objectivity and independence, ensuring transparency.
* **Ethical Training Reminder:** This situation can be used as a reminder to all staff about the importance of timely disclosure of potential conflicts of interest and relationships that could impair independence or objectivity.

By implementing these safeguards, the audit firm can reduce the threats to an acceptable level and maintain both independence in fact and independence in appearance.

### (c) Audit Reporting Implications: Going Concern - Material Uncertainty Adequately Disclosed

*(This part of the answer was included in the prompt but not asked for in the hypothetical question's "Required" section. I will format it as provided.)*

If, after performing procedures (as identified in part (a)3 relating to the supplier issues and overall going concern), the auditor concludes that management's use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, but a material uncertainty exists (e.g., due to the potential severe impact of the key supplier issues on future operations and liquidity), AND this material uncertainty is adequately disclosed in the financial statements by management, the following reporting implications arise as per SLAuS 570 (Revised):

* **Unmodified Audit Opinion:** The auditor would issue an unmodified opinion on the financial statements. This is because the financial statements themselves are not considered materially misstated as the going concern basis is appropriate and the material uncertainty is adequately disclosed.
* **"Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern" Paragraph:** The auditor's report must include a separate section with the heading "Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern." This section will be placed immediately after the "Basis for Opinion" paragraph.
    * It will draw attention to the note in the financial statements where management has disclosed the material uncertainty.
    * It will state that these events or conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern and that the auditor's opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
* **Key Audit Matters (KAMs):** The circumstances giving rise to the material uncertainty related to going concern would typically be considered a Key Audit Matter (KAM) as per SLAuS 701, due to its significance. However, when a "Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern" paragraph is included in the auditor's report, SLAuS 570 (Revised) and SLAuS 701 state that this matter should not also be described in the KAM section. Instead, the KAM section should include a reference to the "Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern" paragraph.

This approach ensures that users of the financial statements are adequately alerted to the material uncertainty without the audit opinion itself being qualified, provided the disclosures are appropriate.
