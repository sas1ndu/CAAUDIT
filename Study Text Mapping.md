# CA Sri Lanka CL1 Auditing: Past Paper (Dec 2020 - June 2024) to Study Text Mapping

I have analyzed the provided Study Texts (Volume I and Volume II) and will now link the past paper questions (from December 2020 to June 2024) to the relevant chapters, mentioning the approximate mark values for the questions or the parts of questions that primarily test concepts from that chapter.

## Methodology:

* Each past paper question (MCQ or structured part) has been mapped to the most relevant chapter in the Study Text.
* MCQs are typically 2 marks each.
* For structured questions, marks are assigned to the primary concept(s) from the chapter being tested in that question or sub-part. These are approximate based on the previous detailed analysis.
* Some questions may draw on concepts from multiple chapters; the primary chapter is chosen for this mapping.

Here is the concept-wise analysis, linked to the Study Text chapters:
