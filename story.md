# The Audit of Innovate Lanka PLC: A Comprehensive Journey

## Part 1: Foundations and Client Acceptance (Illustrating Chapters 1-4)

Rohan, a seasoned partner at "Rohan & Associates," looked at the file for a potential new client: Innovate Lanka PLC, a rapidly expanding tech company specializing in AI-driven logistics solutions. "This will be a challenging but rewarding **Assurance Engagement**," he mused. He knew the **Objective of an External Audit** was critical here: to provide an **Audit Opinion** on whether Innovate Lanka's financial statements gave a **True and Fair View**. This was crucial for their **Stakeholders**, given the company's growth and potential IPO.

The concept of **Accountability, Stewardship, and Agency** was paramount; management (agents) were accountable to the shareholders (principals). An audit would bridge the information gap. Rohan reminded his team of the five **Elements of an Assurance Engagement**: a three-party relationship, subject matter, suitable criteria, evidence, and a written report. They'd be providing **Reasonable Assurance**, not absolute, due to the **Inherent Limitations of Audit**.

Before accepting, they had to ensure the **Preconditions for an Audit** were met, as per **SLAuS 210**. This included Innovate Lanka using an acceptable financial reporting framework and management acknowledging their responsibilities. Rohan drafted the **Audit Engagement Letter**, clearly outlining these responsibilities and the audit scope. He emphasized adherence to **Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs)**, which are formulated by **CA Sri Lanka** and monitored by the **SLAASMB** for **Specified Business Enterprises (SBEs)** like Innovate Lanka (once listed).

The initial team meeting focused on **Professional Scepticism** and **Professional Judgement**. "We need to be alert," Rohan stressed. They discussed **Materiality**, setting a preliminary level for the financial statements as a whole and considering **Performance Materiality** to address risks at a lower level. The core of their early work was **Understanding the Entity and its Environment (SLAuS 315)**, which would feed into their **Audit Risk** assessment. Rohan explained the **Audit Risk Model**: the interplay of **Inherent Risk**, **Control Risk**, and **Detection Risk**.

## Part 2: Understanding Controls and Planning the Strategy (Illustrating Chapters 2, 3, 5 & 15)

The team delved into Innovate Lanka's **Internal Control** system. They used the **COSO Framework** as a guide, evaluating the **Control Environment**, **Risk Assessment Process**, **Control Activities** (like **Segregation of Duties**), the **Information System Relevant to Financial Reporting**, and **Monitoring of Controls**. They documented their findings using **Narrative Notes** and **Flowcharts**, supported by an **Internal Control Questionnaire (ICQ)**.

Given Innovate Lanka's tech focus, **Auditing in a Digital Environment (Chapter 15)** was crucial. They noted Innovate Lanka was exploring **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** for logistics and using **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** for some back-office tasks. The auditors considered the implications of **Big Data** and **Data Analytics** on the audit. Rohan decided they would use **Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATs)**, specifically **Audit Software** for substantive testing and **Test Data** for evaluating application controls. They also noted the client used **Cloud-Based Audit Working Papers** internally, requiring an assessment of their **Cyber Security Controls** to mitigate **Cyber Risks**. They identified relevant **General IT Controls** and **Application Controls**.

The team specifically examined controls in key cycles (Chapter 3):

-   The **Order-to-Receipt Cycle (Sales System):** They checked for authorization of credit, completeness of dispatches being invoiced (using GDNs), and accuracy of pricing.
-   The **Procurement-to-Pay Cycle (Purchases System):** Focus was on authorization of purchases, matching GRNs with invoices, and recording liabilities.
-   The **Payroll Cycle:** Controls over new hires, terminations, and calculation of wages were reviewed.
-   **Control Over Cash Management:** Including bank reconciliations and authorization of payments.
-   **Inventory Controls:** Especially important given their logistics operations.
-   **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) Controls:** For their warehouses and tech infrastructure, focusing on distinguishing **capital from revenue expenditure**.

This understanding fed into the **Overall Audit Strategy** and the detailed **Audit Plan (Chapter 5)**. Rohan decided on a split approach: an **Interim Audit** to focus on controls testing and early substantive work, and a **Final Audit** for year-end balances and final reviews. Given Innovate Lanka had a small, newly acquired subsidiary, the principles of **Group Audits (SLAuS 600)** were briefly discussed, though the main focus remained on the parent. Concepts like **Component Auditor** and **Significant Component** were noted for future growth.

## Part 3: Gathering Audit Evidence (Illustrating Chapters 6-14)

The **Interim Audit** commenced. The team gathered **Sufficient Appropriate Audit Evidence (Chapter 7)**. Rohan reminded them of the qualities of evidence: **Relevance** and **Reliability**, noting that evidence from independent **Sources of Audit Evidence** was generally more reliable. All tests were designed to address specific **Financial Statement Assertions (e.g., Occurrence, Completeness, Accuracy, Cut-off, Classification, Presentation, Existence, Rights and Obligations, Valuation)**. They used various **Audit Procedures** like inspection, observation, enquiry, confirmation, recalculation, and re-performance.

During this phase, they considered **Using the Work of Others (Chapter 6)**. Innovate Lanka had used a specialist for valuing some unique AI algorithms, so the team evaluated this **Management's Expert**. They also assessed if they needed their own **Auditor's Expert** for any complex tech valuations, following **SLAuS 620**. The work of Innovate Lanka's small **Internal Audit** department was considered under **SLAuS 610**, evaluating their competence and objectivity. As Innovate Lanka used a third-party for some data processing, **SLAuS 402** regarding **Service Organisations** was noted.

The auditors were vigilant for **Fraud (SLAuS 240)** and **Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations (NOCLAR) (SLAuS 250)**. They discussed **Fraud Risk Factors** and the two main types: **Fraudulent Financial Reporting** and **Misappropriation of Assets**.

Substantive testing covered various areas:

-   **Tangible Non-Current Assets (Chapter 8):** The team verified additions, disposals, and the reasonableness of depreciation. They confirmed ownership (**rights and obligations**) by inspecting title deeds for their new office. They also considered **Impairment of Assets (LKAS 36)** for some older tech equipment.
-   **Auditing Inventory (Chapter 9):** Given Innovate Lanka's software focus, "inventory" was mostly software licenses and work-in-progress on custom AI solutions. The team attended a symbolic **inventory count** of physical licenses, reviewed the valuation at **lower of cost and NRV (LKAS 2)**, and performed **cut-off testing**.
-   **Audit of Revenue and Receivables (Chapter 10):** This was a high-risk area. They performed a **Receivables Confirmation** using the **positive method**, carefully handling exceptions and non-responses. They performed **analytical procedures** on sales revenue and tested for **completeness** and **occurrence**.
-   **Auditing Cash and Bank Balances (Chapter 11):** The team obtained a **Bank Confirmation Letter**, tested the **bank reconciliation**, and performed **cash cut-off procedures** to check for **window dressing**.
-   **Liabilities, Capital and Expenses (Chapter 12):** They verified trade payables and accruals using **supplier statement reconciliations**, tested **deferred taxation liabilities (LKAS 12)**, and audited employee expenses including **pension schemes (LKAS 19)** and **management remuneration (LKAS 24)**. **Provisions and Contingencies (LKAS 37)** were scrutinized, especially a pending lawsuit. **Stated capital and reserves** were agreed to statutory documents.
-   **Sampling and Other Procedures (Chapter 13):** **Audit Sampling (SLAuS 530)** was used extensively. The team used **statistical sampling** for some tests of controls and **non-statistical (judgmental) sampling** for certain tests of details, including **stratification** of receivables. They were careful to document their **sample selection methods** and how they handled deviations and misstatements, including **projection of misstatements** and comparing these to **tolerable misstatement**. As this was the first year Rohan & Associates audited Innovate Lanka, **Opening Balances (SLAuS 510)** were carefully reviewed, including communication with the predecessor auditor. **Comparative Information (SLAuS 710)** was also checked for consistency.
-   **Audit Review and Finalisation (Chapter 14):** The team focused on **Related Party Transactions (SLAuS 550)**, for which they obtained **written representations**. They performed a **Subsequent Events Review (SLAuS 560)**, distinguishing between **adjusting** and **non-adjusting events**. The **Going Concern (SLAuS 570 Revised)** assessment was critical, given Innovate Lanka's rapid expansion and reliance on new AI contracts. They reviewed management's assessment and considered **going concern indicators**. **Auditing Accounting Estimates (SLAuS 540)**, especially around software development cost capitalization and fair values of AI algorithms, involved scrutinizing management's point estimates and considering **estimation uncertainty**.

## Part 4: Concluding and Reporting (Illustrating Chapters 16-20)

As the **Final Audit** neared completion, Rohan focused on **Evaluating Evidence** and **Audit Reporting (Chapter 16)**. He reviewed all **uncorrected misstatements (SLAuS 450)** and their effect on the **Audit Report (SLAuS 700 Revised)**. The standard **Unmodified Opinion** format was the goal. For Innovate Lanka, a listed company, **Key Audit Matters (KAMs) (SLAuS 701)** had to be identified and communicated. These included the valuation of AI algorithms and revenue recognition for complex AI service contracts.

One area of concern was a significant new government grant received late in the year, which was correctly accounted for but fundamental to understanding the year's performance. Rohan considered an **Emphasis of Matter Paragraph (SLAuS 706 Revised)** to highlight this. If there had been a limitation in scope or a material misstatement that wasn't pervasive, a **Qualified Opinion** would have been issued. If material and pervasive, it would be an **Adverse Opinion** (for misstatement) or a **Disclaimer of Opinion** (for inability to obtain sufficient evidence). Rohan also ensured the team reviewed **Other Information** in the annual report for material inconsistencies (**SLAuS 720 Revised**).

Innovate Lanka then requested a separate **Assurance Engagement (Chapter 17)** on their internal controls over a new cloud platform they were offering (**SLSAE 3000**). This was an **Attestation Engagement**, providing **Limited Assurance**. They also asked for help in preparing their **Prospective Financial Information (PFI)** for a potential new investor, which Rohan & Associates agreed to examine under **SLSAE 3400**, clarifying it would be a **Forecast** based on best-estimates. For a smaller, non-audit client, they had recently performed an **Agreed-Upon Procedures** engagement (**SLSRE 4400**) and a **Compilation Engagement** (**SLSRE 4410**).

Throughout the audit of Innovate Lanka, **Audit Quality Control (Chapter 18)** was paramount. At the firm level, Rohan & Associates adhered to **SLSQC 1**, ensuring strong **leadership responsibilities for quality**, adherence to **ethical requirements**, robust **human resources** policies, quality **engagement performance**, and **monitoring**. For the Innovate Lanka engagement specifically, Rohan ensured compliance with **SLAuS 220**, including proper **direction, supervision, and review**, and an **Engagement Quality Control Review (EQCR)** because Innovate Lanka was a significant, listed-aspirant client. The **Framework for Audit Quality**, considering inputs, process, outputs, interactions, and contextual factors, guided their overall approach.

**Ethics and Ethical Threats (Chapter 19)** were a constant consideration. The team adhered to the **CA Sri Lanka Code of Ethics** and its **Fundamental Principles** (**Integrity, Objectivity, Professional Competence and Due Care, Confidentiality, Professional Behaviour**). A junior team member briefly held a small, indirect financial interest in a supplier to Innovate Lanka, creating a potential **Self-Interest Threat**; this was immediately identified and mitigated. The long association Rohan's firm had with a different (hypothetical) non-audit client was managed to avoid a **Familiarity Threat**. There were no significant **Self-Review Threats** or **Advocacy Threats** with Innovate Lanka. The client was professional and no **Intimidation Threats** arose. Appropriate **Ethical Safeguards** were documented. The firm also had policies regarding **Networks and Network Firms** and managing **Conflicts of Interest**.

Finally, Rohan's team reviewed the work and role of Innovate Lanka's **Internal Audit (Chapter 20)** department. They assessed its effectiveness against the **International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF)** of the **IIA**, noting the **Definition of Internal Auditing** and its adherence to the **Code of Ethics** and **IIA Standards** (both **Attribute** and **Performance**). They reviewed Innovate Lanka's **Internal Audit Charter** which outlined its purpose, authority, and responsibility. The IA team was developing an **Audit Universe** and Plan aligned with organisational risks. They were also involved in **Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)**, and Rohan noted their role as per the **IIA ERM Fan**, ensuring IA maintained its **Independence**. The **Management of Internal Audit** at Innovate Lanka seemed robust, and they had recently conducted a **Governance and Culture Audit**. Rohan's team also noted the **Audit Committee's** oversight of the internal audit function.

With all procedures completed, evidence evaluated, and reports drafted, Rohan felt confident in the **Reasonable Assurance** his firm could provide. The audit of Innovate Lanka PLC was a testament to a thorough application of auditing standards and ethical principles.
