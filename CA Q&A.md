### Progress Test Answers

(1) Objectivity of the function
(2) Technical competence
(3) Due professional care
(4) Effective communication

False.

Fraud is the use of deception to obtain unjust or illegal financial advantage and intentional misrepresentation by management, employees or third parties

False. Auditor's may detect fraud as a result of their procedures but do not have a specific duty to detect fraud.

|                      |                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Management           | If the auditors suspect or detect any fraud (even if immaterial) as soon as they can they should tell management.                                                                 |
| Those charged with governance | If the auditor has identified fraud involving management, employees with significant roles in internal control, or others, if it results in a material misstatement, they must report it to those charged with governance.  |
| Third parties        | Auditors may have a statutory duty to report to a regulator. Auditors are advised to take legal advice if reporting externally to the company.                                  |

The primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud and irregularities rests with management and those charged with governance.

It **is not** the auditor's responsibility to prevent or detect non-compliance with laws and regulations.
